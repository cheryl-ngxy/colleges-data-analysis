# colleges-data-analysis
Positioning and segmentation analysis using R. 

What this project is, is that there is a data file that asks participants to complete a survey.

Q17 tells participants to rank each college/university in terms of the different attributes on a scale of 1-5. 

By analyzing the results of Q17, we can come up with 
1. Snake plot (to compare differences between direct competitors)
2. Perceptual map

These help us to identify and determine a good positioning strategy.
